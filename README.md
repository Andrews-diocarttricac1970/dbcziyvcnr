Just got out the theater, hair still smelling like buttery popcorn, and I think my back is permanently shaped like those terrible seats. Man, Until Dawn, what a dizzying ride. I’m still trying to untangle it all while a cluster of teenagers next to me were still dissecting every scene so loudly I’m surprised I caught any of it. Noise like that on top of my creaky back is definitely some kind of purgatory.

It's like if Alfred Hitchcock directed a haunted house ride, with jump scares plastered all over like a drunken baker’s frosting. The place was cold, too. Needed a scarf instead of popcorn, I swear. Y'know, for warmth. But there were these eerie shadows that hung behind the characters, like stubborn laundry refusing to dry. Does that even make sense?

> The bit with the cabin and all the flickering lights, like my cousin’s rave at Thanksgiving, where they hired a DJ who was clearly allergic to tempo? But those whispers — God, they had me checking for ghosts under my own seat. Maybe they were hiding under the soda spills the size of mini-lakes down there.

Did I even tell you about the guy with the weird mask? Felt like he was orchestrating some elaborate game, moving people around like they were chess pieces on a board shaped like Mount Fumblemore. The forest scenes, those are something I'll dream about tonight—nature's twisted fingers reaching out during a storm, trying to claw me back into the seats.

Oh, right, I remember you asked how to download the movie or whether to just wait to watch the movie. It's probably worth a home watch, especially if you need time to breathe and maybe have a snack that doesn't try to pretend it's a meal when it's just popcorn.

And my mind keeps flashing back to this one line, something about secrets being like shadows — can't remember the exact words though, too foggy now but kinda cool, right? Would be profound if it didn’t feel like spoken through a witch’s cauldron, still stirring with yesterday's conversation.
